      <description> Goal Vault is aiming at improving security of the containers by rotating token and credential much more often than usual. Looks like it is especially effectiv to help rotate passwords used to access internal databases.

      <description> Goal Istio is aiming at improving security of the containers. One of the key aspects is the end to end encryption of the commnucation, the role of citadel to ensure the management of the certificates, the renewal of the certificates. As always, the goal of this post is to study that new tool and figure out I can leverage it in my day to day work.

      <description>Goal One of the biggest security risks related to Kubernetes are often linked to the fact that it is really hard to ensure that only &amp;ldquo;approved&amp;rdquo; images are deployed in your Kubernetes cluster. The goal here is to leverage Notary and the a project called &amp;ldquo;Portieris&amp;rdquo; created by IBM.
Key Aspects  Rebuild the Notary Rebuild and Deploy Portieris using Helm  Build Notary Clone go get github.com/theupdateframework/notary go install -tags pkcs11 github.</description>
