      <description> Goal Istio is aiming at improving security of the containers. One of the key aspects is the end to end encryption of the commnucation, the role of citadel to ensure the management of the certificates, the renewal of the certificates. As always, the goal of this post is to study that new tool and figure out I can leverage it in my day to day work.

      <description>Goal  The main goal is to use statefulset and local persistency volume. The arm32v7 image are not available on kubernetes example repository The arm32v7 images are not available either on the docker hub, probably because Cassandra advises to use 64 bits when PI 3 are still mainly 32 bits OS and that the amount of memory available is limited to 1Gbi.  Build Cassandra for PI 3 Cassandra 1 Based on various Cassandra running on RPI projects</description>

      <description>Goal During the installation of official Kubernetes 1.11.0 on RPI Cluster 1, encountered a bug on the controller manager preventing the controller-manager from starting. The problem here was to be able to cross compiled the latest version of Kubernetes 1.11.1 before the code was officially released and of course rebuild the images.
Key Aspects  The bug had been fixed by the Kubernetes kube-controller-manager - panic: runtime error: index out of range has been fixed and will be built as part of 1.</description>

      <description>Goal In order to get the nodes and pods interface with each other accross the cluster. This post describes how I deployed Flannel acounting with the fact that some of the nodes have multiple interfaces (wlan0 and eth0).
Key Aspects  Flannel seems to deploy ok. Looks like in trouble when multiple interfaces available Calico in not compiled by default for Rapsberry PI  Flannel Setup through kubectl $ mkdir -p $HOME/kube-deployments/flannel $ cd $HOME/kube-deployments/flannel $ curl -sSL https://rawgit.</description>

      <description>Goal Even if the ultimate goal is to manage completly the cluster using Kubernetes, the ability to use Ansible during debug process is very usefull. The goal here is to setup ansible inventory, basic playbooks.
Ansible Installation on the master node Let&amp;rsquo;s install ansible using apt-get. A lot of python related depedencies are also installed.

      <description>Goal In order to transforme a PI into a home automation controller, it is necessary to add Zwave and ZigBee capabilities to the the Wifi and Bluetooth capabilities of the PI.
Key  Transform Raspberry-PI + Dongle into a SUC ZWave controller Try to use with OpenHAB or HomeAssistant  Testing on the OpenHAB Container The OpenHAB architecture is Java based.
Testing on the HomeAssistant Container HomeAssistant is Python based and relies on OpenZWave.</description>

      <description>Goal OpenHAB running on Raspberry PI is one of way where you don&amp;rsquo;t have to rely on outside services to orchestrate your IOT. Then comes the issues of high availability of the software if only running on one PI. By dockerizing the software first, this open the doors to leverage a kubernetes cluster to ensure HA of the software
Key Aspects  Use the 3 nodes Raspeberry Cluster Access the WIFI, ZWave and Zigbee network Leverage the Nortek HUSBZB-1 Zwave and Zigbee dongle.</description>

      <description>Goal Also GCE is perfect to learn Kubernetes, building Kubernetes on top of PI Cluster brings another dimension to the learning, from setting up the OS, partitionning the OS, DHCP, NAT, cross compiling for the ARM32V7.
Key Aspects  Build a Raspberry 3B+ Cluster Deploy Kubernetes on that Cluster  Hardware Reference Links  Video  Procedure  Kind of followed the video Used a premade rack instead. Adapt to Raspberry 3B+ (1Gb card instead of 100Mb card)  Result Cluster 1: 5 nodes cluster Cluster 2: 3 nodes cluster OS Reference Links  Video HypriotOS  Procedure  Use HypriotOS because the quickest to set up.</description>

      <description>Goal I encountered multiple issues trying to repartition my SD on my PI. Because the / directory is mounted, it never really worked safely for me to use fdisk. Morevoer some of the powerfull tools such as gparted need X11 installed, which I don&amp;rsquo;t have by default.
Hopefully the new PI3 B and B+ are able to boot from USB, hence the idea of creating a Rescue Dongle

      <description>Goal During some of the manipulation of the partition table of my SD card, I ended up screwing up both my SD card and my backup Win32DiskImage backup. Moreover if your SD card is 32G, it takes around 30 minute to restore from backup. Hence the idea to come up with a way to build more resiliency in the cluster. Recreating a node from scratch should not take more than 10 mn.</description>
