      <description> Goal Vault is aiming at improving security of the containers by rotating token and credential much more often than usual. Looks like it is especially effectiv to help rotate passwords used to access internal databases.

      <description> Goal Istio is aiming at improving security of the containers. One of the key aspects is the end to end encryption of the commnucation, the role of citadel to ensure the management of the certificates, the renewal of the certificates. As always, the goal of this post is to study that new tool and figure out I can leverage it in my day to day work.

      <description>Goal During the installation of official Kubernetes 1.11.0 on RPI Cluster 1, encountered a bug on the controller manager preventing the controller-manager from starting. The problem here was to be able to cross compiled the latest version of Kubernetes 1.11.1 before the code was officially released and of course rebuild the images.
Key Aspects  The bug had been fixed by the Kubernetes kube-controller-manager - panic: runtime error: index out of range has been fixed and will be built as part of 1.</description>

      <description>Goal In order to get the nodes and pods interface with each other accross the cluster. This post describes how I deployed Flannel acounting with the fact that some of the nodes have multiple interfaces (wlan0 and eth0).
Key Aspects  Flannel seems to deploy ok. Looks like in trouble when multiple interfaces available Calico in not compiled by default for Rapsberry PI  Flannel Setup through kubectl $ mkdir -p $HOME/kube-deployments/flannel $ cd $HOME/kube-deployments/flannel $ curl -sSL https://rawgit.</description>

      <description>Goal Even if the ultimate goal is to manage completly the cluster using Kubernetes, the ability to use Ansible during debug process is very usefull. The goal here is to setup ansible inventory, basic playbooks.
Ansible Installation on the master node Let&amp;rsquo;s install ansible using apt-get. A lot of python related depedencies are also installed.
sudo apt-get install ansible Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree Reading state information...

      <description>Goal Also GCE is perfect to learn Kubernetes, building Kubernetes on top of PI Cluster brings another dimension to the learning, from setting up the OS, partitionning the OS, DHCP, NAT, cross compiling for the ARM32V7.
Key Aspects  Build a Raspberry 3B+ Cluster Deploy Kubernetes on that Cluster  Hardware Reference Links  Video  Procedure  Kind of followed the video Used a premade rack instead. Adapt to Raspberry 3B+ (1Gb card instead of 100Mb card)  Result Cluster 1: 5 nodes cluster Cluster 2: 3 nodes cluster OS Reference Links  Video HypriotOS  Procedure  Use HypriotOS because the quickest to set up.</description>

      <title>Create a Rapsberry PI Rescue Dongle</title>
      <link>/post/2018-06-20-a/</link>

      <description>Goal I encountered multiple issues trying to repartition my SD on my PI. Because the / directory is mounted, it never really worked safely for me to use fdisk. Morevoer some of the powerfull tools such as gparted need X11 installed, which I don&amp;rsquo;t have by default.
Hopefully the new PI3 B and B+ are able to boot from USB, hence the idea of creating a Rescue Dongle
Consideration regarding USB boot.</description>

      <title>Add Raspberry PI node to Kubernetes Cluster in 10 min</title>

      <description>Goal During some of the manipulation of the partition table of my SD card, I ended up screwing up both my SD card and my backup Win32DiskImage backup. Moreover if your SD card is 32G, it takes around 30 minute to restore from backup. Hence the idea to come up with a way to build more resiliency in the cluster. Recreating a node from scratch should not take more than 10 mn.</description>
